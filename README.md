# PathSet Modules for VCV Rack

The Path Set is family an eclectic and bespoke of plugins for [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com/).

## Path Set - Infinity
The Infinity set explores modules with near-infinite internal configurations. These internal signatures can be randomizes but are unlikely to be found again once changed.
